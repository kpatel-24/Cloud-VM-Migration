🌐 Cloud Computing Load Balancing using Java CloudSim

🔧 Developed Two Algorithms: Created random selection and least loaded VM migration algorithms to balance workloads between two servers.

💻 Simulated with CloudSim: Used CloudSim to model and test the algorithms in a cloud computing environment.

📊 Performance Evaluation: Assessed key metrics such as CPU utilization, response time, and system throughput.

🚀 Results: The least loaded algorithm provided better load balancing, leading to improved system performance and reliability.
